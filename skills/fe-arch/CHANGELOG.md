# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- The gate no longer runs on every session start. It runs when the prompt names frontend work, or when a write touches `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, or `.svelte`.
- `rules/fe-implementation.md` is a pointer to `skills/fe-arch/SKILL.md`. The procedure stays in the skill.

## 1.1.0

- Renamed the plugin and the skill from `fe-architecture-reuse-perf` to `fe-arch`. The workflow is unchanged.

## 1.0.0
- Packaged the rewritten skill as one plugin for Claude Code and omp.
- `SKILL.md` keeps the workflow, the output template, and the hard rules. Detail stays in `references/`.
- Removed the loose root copies (`SKILL (1).md`, `ownership.md`, `reuse.md`, `performance.md`).
- No external doc links. The reference text is the local rewrite.
